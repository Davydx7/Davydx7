## 👋 Hi, I'm David — an Experienced Frontend Engineer

I'm a result-driven front-end developer with 5+ years of professional experience crafting intuitive, scalable, and maintainable web applications. I specialize in building robust user interfaces with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **modular architecture**, often working across the full software lifecycle—from **technical specs** to **production-ready deployments**.

### 🚀 What I Do Best

- Architect **component libraries** and frontend systems for scalable apps
- Bridge **product goals** with **clean, maintainable code**
- Build tools and UI logic that feel intuitive, performant, and reliable
- Shape **internal developer experience** through tooling and sane abstraction
- Drive frontend structure in monorepos, modular systems, and cross-functional teams

### 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

💡 **Build with clarity** – Code should be easy to reason about, modify, and extend  
🧭 **Plan as an architect** – Define intent and structure implementation and execution  
🔧 **Know your tools** – Deep understanding of frameworks and packages you rely on  
🤝 **Collaborate deeply** – Align tech with business needs, user impact, and product goals
