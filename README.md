# Hello! :octocat:
## Welcome to my Repository

### About Me
A ReactTs Developer making the DevWorld a little better place one project at a time!  
Found of Logic, reasoning and Understanding how my deps work 'under the hood' 
🔹 Fundamentals is Key  
🔹 The documentation good? I'm good!  
🔹 Clean and simple Logic is Good Code

### Ideology
⭐ Define the problem and the desired state  
⭐ A known solution exists ? comprehend, implement and optimize  
⭐ No clearly defined solution ? hack a working logic, implement, refactor and optimize  
⭐ Hack a working MVP system before Optimizing composition logic, this makes for a better tailored implementation
